# Kids, earn more gaming time here!

# SEIR-FLEX-123  Project Number Five - May 2020
This project allows a child to earn more time for gaming by answering math questions.

The primary user is a kid who is subject to parental controls or other limits on their screen time.
This application allows them to earn more time by answering questions and fires off an email to their parent
when specific thresholds are reached.

## My "Teach yourself something new" project elements are React Hooks, Context API and React Router

## This project utilizes the following technologies under the hood:
- React
- Ruby on Rails
- React Hooks and Context API
- React Router
- Postgresql
- React Bootstrap


## The application URL
TBD

## Future Refinements
- Implement 'Restart Game' option
- Leverage useReducer Hook to streamline use of context.
- Implement user authentication.

## Defects / "Would be better if" Items
- useEffect causing interesting loop when loading questions from the database.
- UserContext not setting currentUser value in state as expected.
- GameOver method should display player stats for the current session.
- Automatically render the next question once the user submits their answer
